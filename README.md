# C/C++ Lint Action Test Repository

[![cpp-linter as action](https://github.com/cpp-linter/test-cpp-linter-action/actions/workflows/cpp-lint-action.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cpp-linter/test-cpp-linter-action/actions/workflows/cpp-lint-action.yml) [![cpp-linter as pkg](https://github.com/cpp-linter/test-cpp-linter-action/actions/workflows/cpp-lint-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cpp-linter/test-cpp-linter-action/actions/workflows/cpp-lint-package.yml)

This is a test repository which has added `cpp-linter.yml`, so when an unformatted c/c++ source file was committed and create a Pull Request will automatically recognize and add warning comments.

If you have any suggestions or contributions, welcome to create issues/PRs [here](https://github.com/cpp-linter/cpp-linter-action).
