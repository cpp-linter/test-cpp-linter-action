# C/C++ Lint Action Demo Repository

[![cpp-linter](https://github.com/shenxianpeng/cpp-linter-action-demo/actions/workflows/cpp-linter.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shenxianpeng/cpp-linter-action-demo/actions/workflows/cpp-linter.yml)

This is a test repository which has added `cpp-linter.yml`, so when an unformatted c/c++ source file was committed and create a Pull Request will automatically recognize and add warning comments.

For example, this PR [#7](https://github.com/shenxianpeng/cpp-linter-action-demo/pull/7), and warning message like below:

![github-actions bot](https://github.com/shenxianpeng/cpp-linter-action-demo/blob/master/img/result.png?raw=true)

Please feel free to commit code to this demo repo and create a Pull Request to see how the process works.
